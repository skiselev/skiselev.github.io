# Binary Clock

This project is a "geeky" (there are 10 types of people...) style binary clock.

The schematics is similar to [John Hall's Binary Clock](John_Hall - Building_a_Binary_Clock.pdf).
But my clock design uses 50Hz signal from mains (European standard) for timebase frequency generation, tens of hours/minutes/seconds are displayed separately from ones, making the clock easier to read for not a binary kind of people, and I also prefer a 24 hours display (which is also European standard?!) instead of 12 hours. Additionally I use 2Hz signal to set time, which makes setting time twice faster, and the clock has a correction (reset seconds) button.
